<p>Sometimes I can't shake the nagging feeling that I am simply not a very good programmer. I mean, after all, in a world full of budding programmers, statistically <em>someone</em> has to be below average at programming, right?</p> 

<p>There's at least a few good reasons behind the self doubt of my programming competency, namely the following:</p>

<p><strong>I did not major in Computer Science, or even in any related STEM fields.</strong></p>

<p>It inevitably comes up right away in phone interviews: "Why didn't you major in CS?" I really wished I had picked up programming much earlier than in my junior year of college. I _really_ do. Well actually, I did take an Intro to Programming college course during the summer of 7th grade, but I guess that course lacked the sufficient oomph to lead me down a career in programming. I blame Visual Basic 6; if the course was taught in any C-based language instead, I'm pretty sure I would be a rockstar programmer by now. Just kidding, but I still think that Visual Basic is truly terrible.</p>
